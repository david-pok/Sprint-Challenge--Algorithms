#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
(n)
the loop is (n) while the rest of the stuff is (1)

b)
(n^2)
the nested loops are n^2 and the rest is basically (1)

c)
(n)
recursively calling the function by adding 2 to a count while subtracting 1 from input comes out to around (n)
## Exercise II

Go to the middle floor/split building in half and drop egg. If it breaks, we go to the middle of the lower half. If it doesn't break, go to the middle of the upper half. Keep splitting halves in half, going down if it breaks, going up if it does not break. Kind of like that one sort that I dont remember the name of.
